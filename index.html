            <p>The <b>Suicide Deaths in Australia data</b> is a dataset that shows the yearly number 
              of suicide deaths broken down into various features.
              <br><br> In the 2020 edition, the Suicide Deaths data looks at various ways the suicide deaths are broken down in 2020 
              and some trends from 2011-2020, some of the ways the data is broken down are: <b>Suicide Deaths By States</b>, 
              <b>Indigenous and non-Indigenous Suicide Deaths</b>, <b>External causes of Suicide Deaths</b> and 
              <b>Mechanisms of Suicide Deaths</b>. 
              <br><br> This visualisation aims to explore the different perspectives to see what they tell us about Suicide Deaths in 
              Australia in 2020.

                    there is also an <b>increase in mental health awareness</b> which is a leading cause of suicide deaths throughout schoold and workplaces. The effect of this 
                    increase in awareness is shown through the decreasing rate of suicide deaths from 2019-2020.
                    <br><br>Suicide continues to be the leading cause of death for 15-44 year olds and it also accounts for the highest number
                    of years of potential life lost as a high proportion of suicides occur within the younger age groups.
