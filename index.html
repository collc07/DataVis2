                    <h1>Suicide Deaths in Australia</h1>
                    <p>The <b>Suicide Deaths in Australia data</b> is a dataset that shows the yearly number 
                    of suicide deaths broken down into various features.
                    <br><br> In the 2020 edition, the Suicide Deaths data looks at various ways the suicide deaths are broken down in 2020 
                    and some trends from 2011-2020, some of the ways the data is broken down are: <b>Suicide Deaths By States</b>, 
                    <b>Indigenous and non-Indigenous Suicide Deaths</b>, <b>External causes of Suicide Deaths</b> and 
                    <b>Mechanisms of Suicide Deaths</b>. 
                    <br><br> This visualisation aims to explore the different perspectives to see what they tell us about Suicide Deaths in 
                    Australia in 2020.

                            <p>Overall, the total number of suicide deaths has <b>increased</b> from 2011 to 2020, more specifically, the <span style="color:#D7BDE2"><b>20-24 years old </b></span>age group. However,
                            there is also an <b>increase in mental health awareness</b> which is a leading cause of suicide deaths throughout schoold and workplaces. The effect of this 
                            increase in awareness is shown through the decreasing rate of suicide deaths from 2019-2020.
                            <br><br>Suicide continues to be the leading cause of death for <b>15-44 year olds</b> and it also accounts for the highest number
                            of years of potential life lost as a high proportion of suicides occur within the younger age groups.

                            amongst non-Indigenous males. It is also the <b>tenth</b> leading cause of deaths amongst Indigenous females compared to it being the

                            <br><br>This is a cause of concern as this means many Indigenous deaths are premature and an increase in effort
